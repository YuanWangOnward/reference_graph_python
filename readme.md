# Introduction

    Researcher do a lot of literature survey, which is always a pain,
    pain, in the sense that it is hard to get the 'big picture' of a field
    facing the endless and messy papers. There should be auto tools allowing people
    to find out the most influential works and
    see how the studies of a field evolves along time.
    However I cannot find myself a satisfactory one and I decided to make one myself.
    The main functionality of this tool includes:
    <ul>
        <li >
            Given a set of papers, visualize their relationship as a graph.
            Graph nodes are papers and they are arranged chronologically.
            Graph edges indicate citation relationship.
        </li>
        <li >
            Features of each paper can be attached to the nodes.
            Influential papers are highlighted.
        </li>
        <li >
            Given a set of papers, the tool is able to find the most related
            papers in terms of citation relationship. Namely, expand your paper pool.
        </li>
    </ul>

Fig. 2 Reference graph for deep learning based sentence representation
and classification. Node color and font size encode the citation
number of each graph indicating its impact of the community. In this
graph, it's very easy to find out the influential works and how the
field evolves along time.
