# Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
<p>
Researcher do a lot of literature survey, which is always a pain,
pain, in the sense that it is hard to get the 'big picture' of a field
facing the endless and messy papers. I'm trying to develop an auto tool to
alleviate the problem. The tool has two main functions:
<ul>
    <li >
        Given a set of papers, visualize their relationship as a graph.
        Graph nodes are papers and they should be arranged chronologically.
        Graph edges indicate citation relationship.
        Highlights of each paper should be attached to the nodes.
        Nodes should be visualized in the way to make it very easy to see the
        most impactful ones.
    </li>
    <li >
        Given a set of papers, the tool should be able to find the most related
        papers in terms of citation relationship. Namely, expand your pool.
    </li>
</ul>

Fig. 2 Reference graph for deep learning based sentence representation
and classification. Node color and font size encode the citation
number of each graph indicating its impact of the community. In this
graph, it's very easy to find out the influential works and how the
field evolves along time.
